# Variables = Variables are the containers to store the data

Name = 'Tauheed'
Integer = 10

# Dynamic Typing = python offer a facility of dynamic typing for variables so tthat we don√Ωt have to defiine the datatype of the variable 
# we are going to store and it's called dynamic typing

# Static typing =  It is a type issue we faces in some other programing langaugaes such as c and c++ java, as we have to define the datatype of the data we are going to sotre inb the variable

# Dynamic binding = It is a type of facility which is offered by python as we can overwrite the stored value of a variable
# such as if we are storing a integer incially in a variable but now we have overwrited it witha string the python will handle it for us but in other programing languages we face a issues called static binding so that if we have declaered the datatype of a variable in the initiation we cannot overwtire it with any other datatype
